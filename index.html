        This is the main content area. It is styled with main in the CSS style
        sheet and contains the primary information for the page. Please note
        that I really don't have a topic or theme for this page and as such I
        will simply cover what I can about the elements and styling I am using.
        I would also like to note that I am doing this assignment slightly
        backwards from the instructions as I am using what css I already have
        and am going from there, that being said I still plan to build my css
        around my html and not the other way around.
